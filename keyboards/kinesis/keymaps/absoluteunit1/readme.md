# The default keymap for kinesis-advantage

This keymap is the same as the one in the `default` directory, but is
formatted to use the `LAYOUT_pretty` matrix, which places the two halves of
the keyboard side-by-side, rather than the left-hand side being on top.

This is the layout that I use, and I find it much more comfortable than the common layouts used for the Kinesis Advantage.
